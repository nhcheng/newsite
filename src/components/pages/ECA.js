          <p> Despite my age, I was able to enjoy most of the activities a typical Imperial Hong Kong student would join in their first years.
            But my age stopped me from engaging more (Imperial College Union (ICU) did not allow me to run for committee positions. I even have difficulties
            in entering the ICU building at night). </p>

                to conservation. </li>
                <li> <b>Oxford Model Legislative Council (OMLC):</b> We were responsible to draft and put forward a "model bill" related to 
                national security matters to the Model Legislative Council (Hong Kong equivalent to parliament/congress) for debate. </li>

                  bi-annual (?) magazine on ICPASS event highlights and proses. I think I have written a note on maximum likelihood
